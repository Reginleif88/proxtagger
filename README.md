## Overview

ProxTagger provides a simple yet powerful web interface to manage tags for your Proxmox VMs and containers. It simplifies tag management with individual and bulk operations, while also offering backup and restore functionality to safeguard your tagging system which is currently not backed up by Promox Backup Server. The interface uses dynamic tables for easy sorting, pagination, and advanced searching.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Tag Management**
   - View all VMs and containers with their tags in an interactive table (powered by DataTables) supporting sorting and pagination.
   - Add/remove tags to individual VMs with a clean, intuitive interface and improved visual feedback.
   - Perform bulk operations to add or remove tags across multiple VMs, with selection persisting across pages/filters.
   - Button to easily clear the current VM selection in the bulk panel.
- **Advanced Filtering & Search**
   - Filter VMs/Containers by Host, VMID range, and Name pattern using the dedicated filter panel.
   - Select all VMs/Containers that match the current filter criteria with a single click.
   - Global search bar supporting **regular expressions** for powerful table filtering across all columns.
- **Backup & Restore**
   - Download tag configurations as JSON files.
   - Restore tags from previous backups.
   - Automatic tag backup on initial setup.
- **Interactive UI**
   - Dynamic table enhances Browse large numbers of VMs/Containers.
   - Consistent toast notifications provide feedback for user actions.
- **Security & Flexibility**
   - Uses Proxmox API tokens for secure authentication.
   - Uses official Promox APIs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- A Proxmox VE server
- API token with appropriate permissions (`VM.Audit` and `VM.Config.Options`)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/reginleif88/proxtagger.git](https://github.com/reginleif88/proxtagger.git)
    cd proxtagger
    ```

2.  Install dependencies or do it in virtual env:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  Run the application:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

4.  Access the web interface:
    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` (it also binds to other interfaces, you can change it in `app.py`)

## Configuration

### API Token Setup

You'll need a Proxmox API token with the following permissions:

- `VM.Audit` (to list VMs and containers)
- `VM.Config.Options` (to read and modify tags)

To create an API token:

1.  Log in to your Proxmox web interface
2.  Navigate to Datacenter â†’ Permissions â†’ API Tokens
3.  Click "Add" and follow the prompts
4.  **Important:** Note down both the token ID/name and secret - the secret is only shown once!
5.  Ensure the token has the required privileges (VM.Audit, VM.Config.Options)

### First-time Setup

1.  On first launch, you'll be prompted to enter your Proxmox connection details:
    - Host (IP or domain)
    - Port (default: 8006)
    - User (e.g., root@pam)
    - Token name and value
    - SSL verification toggle (disable for self-signed certificates)

2.  After successful connection, the system automatically creates an initial tag backup

## Usage Guide

### VM/Container Table

- Use the search bar (top right) to filter the table. **Regex is supported.** Use the 'X' button to clear the search.
- Click column headers to sort the table.
- Use the pagination controls at the bottom to navigate through pages if you have many VMs/Containers.

### Tag Management

- **Individual Tags**: Click the "+" button in the "Tags" column for any VM/Container to add tags individually. Click the 'x' on a tag chip to remove it.
- **Bulk Operations**: Use the "Bulk Tag Management" panel to perform actions on multiple VMs/Containers:
    - Select VMs/Containers using the checkboxes in the first column. Your selections are remembered even if you change pages or apply filters.
    - Use the "Filter VMs" section within the bulk panel to narrow down the list by Host, VMID range, or Name pattern. Click "Select All Filtered" to quickly select all VMs matching your filters.
    - Click "Clear Selected VMs" to deselect all currently checked VMs/Containers.
    - Choose "Add Tags" or "Remove Tags" operation.
    - Select existing tags or create new ones (new tags only possible in "Add" mode).
    - Click "Apply" to execute the changes on all selected VMs/Containers.

### Backup & Restore

- **Export Tags**: Click "Export Tags" in the sidebar to download a backup JSON file.
- **Import Tags**: Click "Import Tags" and select a previously exported backup file.
- **Note**: When restoring tags, the system matches VMs by VMID, Node, and Type, and replaces all existing tags with imported ones. Feedback is provided if VMs from the backup file cannot be found.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **No VMs Visible**: Ensure your API token has `VM.Audit` and `VM.Config.Options` permissions at the appropriate level (/ or node-specific).
- **Connection Failed**: Check your hostname, port and network connectivity.
- **SSL Errors**: Toggle off SSL verification if you're using self-signed certificates.
- **Regex Search Issues**: Ensure you are using valid JavaScript regex syntax in the search bar. Invalid patterns may cause errors or unexpected results (check dev console).

## Technical Details

ProxTagger is built using:

- **Backend**: Python with Flask web framework. Uses Jinja2 for templating.
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5 for styling, [DataTables](https://datatables.net/) for table interactivity, and custom JavaScript organized into ES Modules.
- **Storage**: Local configuration file (`config.json`) for connection details.
